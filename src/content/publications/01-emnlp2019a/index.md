title: "Enhancing Context Modeling with a Query-Guided Capsule Network for Document-level Translation"
summary: "A query-guided capsule networks to cluster context information into different perspectives from which the target translation may concern and can significantly outperform strong baselines on multiple data sets of different domains is proposed."
abstract: "Context modeling is essential to generate coherent and consistent translation for Document-level Neural Machine Translations. The widely used method for document-level translation usually compresses the context information into a representation via hierarchical attention networks. However, this method neither considers the relationship between context words nor distinguishes the roles of context words. To address this problem, we propose a query-guided capsule networks to cluster context information into different perspectives from which the target translation may concern. Experiment results show that our method can significantly outperform strong baselines on multiple data sets of different domains."
