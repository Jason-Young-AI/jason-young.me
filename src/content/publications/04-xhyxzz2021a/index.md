title: "Big Medical Data and Medical AI Standards: Status Quo,Opportunities and Challenges"
summary: "An innovative architecture consisting of big-data-and-AI-enhanced medical information systems and the big medical science infrastructure is proposed, which combines data-related standards, public datasets, benchmarks, codes of practice, and state-of-the-art and state of the practice of big medical data and standards of medical AI."
abstract: "Big medical data and medical artificial intelligence (AI) not only have the great potential for improving the utilization of medical resources and the quality of medical service, but also pose challenges to privacy protection and technical risks. Standards are the consensus and norms for constructing, evaluating, and applying new technologies. The clinical application of big medical data and medical AI urgently needs regulations on data, systems, measurement standards, and codes of practice for evaluating new technologies. This paper defines big medical data and standards of medical AI, including data-related standards, public datasets, benchmarks, codes of practice, and summarizes state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice of big medical data and standards of medical AI. While looking forward to the development prospect of big medical data and medical AI, we propose an innovative architecture consisting of big-data-and-AI-enhanced medical information systems and the big medical science infrastructure."
