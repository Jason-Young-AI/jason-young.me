I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Prof. Jianfeng Zhan.

My research is centered on **Evaluatology for Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on scientifically and objectively evaluating AI's performance in real-world applications. My early work concentrated on Neural Machine Translation; however, I identified the paramount importance of evaluating AI systems' actual capabilities in real-world applications. This insight prompted me to dedicate my scholarly pursuits to the emerging field of Evaluatology for AI.

Currently, my research endeavors are concentrated on "characterizing the distribution of neural network architectures in real-world scenarios" and "systematically evaluating the practical performance of deep learning models."
